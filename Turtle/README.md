Python Turtle Race

This Python script utilizes the Turtle module to simulate a colorful turtle race on a graphical user interface. Users can select a turtle color to bet on, and the turtles move across the screen with randomized speeds until one of them reaches the finish line. The script then determines the winning turtle based on its color and notifies the user whether their bet was successful.

Features:
- Allows users to bet on a turtle color for the race.
- Creates an animated turtle race using the Turtle module.
- Randomizes the speed of each turtle for unpredictability.
- Determines the winning turtle and notifies the user accordingly.

Usage:
1. Run the Python script.
2. Enter the color of the turtle you want to bet on.
3. Watch the turtles race across the screen.
4. Receive a notification about the winning turtle and the outcome of your bet.

This script is a fun demonstration of using Python's Turtle module for simple animations and interactive user input. It can be customized with additional features and enhancements for educational purposes or entertainment.
